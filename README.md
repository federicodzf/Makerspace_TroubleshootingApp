# Makerspace_TroubleshootingApp #
Project for the University of Denver's Innovation Labs - Digital Lab.

Interactive UI/GUI that guides users on assessing 3D printer issues, particularly with Prusa Minis. The idea is to embed a troubleshooting flowchart into a more user-friendly and client-oriented application to aid space facilitators, students, faculty, and staff of DU in the process of fixing a broken/"down" printer. 

The draft troubleshooting flowchart can be seen below:

The first step is to develop the UI/GUI using the tkinter python library to ask the most simple questions in order to verify functionality and user-friendliness.
