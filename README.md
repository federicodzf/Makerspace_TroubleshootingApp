# Makerspace_TroubleshootingApp #
Project for the University of Denver's Innovation Labs - Digital Lab.

Interactive UI/GUI that guides users on assessing 3D printer issues, particularly with Prusa Minis. The idea is to embed a troubleshooting flowchart into a more user-friendly and client-oriented application to aid space facilitators, students, faculty, and staff of DU in the process of fixing a broken/"down" printer. 

The draft troubleshooting flowchart can be seen below:

The first step is to develop the UI/GUI using the tkinter python library to ask the most simple questions in order to verify functionality and user-friendliness. 

Updates: Functionality has been tested => flow works as expected. Application aesthetics still need some work, as well as the addition of QR codes and hyperlinks to the Prusa Knowledge base in case of extra help or problem is too complex for the app to handle.
